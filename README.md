# JobScrapper
The script searches for software engineering jobs on Monster.com. The user can filter out results using specific key words and location.

Potential additions: 

1) Create a UI for the user to enter the Location and Key Words and display the results in a grid.
2) Make the program flexible for any job (instead of only software engineering). --Currently in progress
3) Look for websites which follow similar HTML structure and add the option to look into multiple sites (instead of only Monster.com)
